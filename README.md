## Introduction

Fractals are fascinating mathematical objects that exhibit intricate patterns at every scale. Fractool provides a platform to generate, visualize, and explore various types of fractals. Whether you're a mathematician, a computer scientist, or simply curious about fractals, Fractool offers an intuitive interface to interact with these mesmerizing structures.

## Features

- **Fractal Generation**: Generate popular fractals such as Mandelbrot Set, Julia Set, Sierpinski Triangle, etc.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Zoom, pan, and explore fractals in real-time to discover their intricate details.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters such as iteration count, color schemes, and rendering options to customize your fractal experience.
- **Export**: Save generated fractals as images for further analysis or sharing.
